/**
Write a command-line script that takes a
file as input and compresses it using the different algorithms available in the
zlib module (Brotli, Deflate, Gzip). You want to produce a summary table
that compares the algorithm's compression time and compression efficiency
on the given file. Hint: This could be a good use case for the fork pattern, but
remember that we made some important performance considerations when
we discussed it earlier in this chapter.
